# 🌐 Minimalist Social Media Web App

A clean, full-stack social media platform built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **PostgreSQL**, **EJS**, and **Passport.js (local strategy)**. Designed with simplicity in mind, this app brings together key features of classic social platforms—**authentication**, **posting**, **likes**, **follows**, and **search**—while maintaining clarity in architecture and UI.

Whether you're browsing user profiles, liking posts, or connecting with others, everything feels intuitive and purposefully minimal.
